betza
=====

Item for transforming betza notation into movement diagrams.

It will transform it first through parsed lumps of betza notation,
then into a list of locations
and finally into a diagram.

This modular approach is used in hopes that one of the components might be useful
(because the combination of the three of them in this way certainly won't be!)
